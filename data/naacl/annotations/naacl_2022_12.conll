In O

through O
the O

of O

, O
in O
which O

either O
an O

In O

to O
building O
a O

we O
demonstrate O
that O
there O
are O

We O

Introduction O
Correct O
interpretation O
of O
language O
must O
take O
into O
account O
not O
only O
the O
meaning O
of O

, O
but O
also O
characteristics O
of O
the O
speaker O
and O
the O
context O
in O
which O
their O

Modeling O
the O

This O

a O

we O

which O
each O

An O

The O
task O
of O
identifying O
deception O
in O
dialog O
is O
far O
from O
solved. O
Our O
classification B-TaskName
methods O
, O
while O
not O
accurate O
enough O
to O
reliably O
identify O
deceptive O
players O
in O
a O
game O
, O
do O
show O
that O
the O
text O
of O
a O
dialog O
in O
the O
setting O
we O
study O
does O
contain O
information O
about O
the O
roles O
of O
the O
participants O
, O
even O
when O
those O
participants O
are O
motivated O
to O
hide O
those O
characteristics O
by O
deceiving O
the O
listener. O
Although O
the O
models O
and O
results O
described O
in O
this O
work O
only O
apply O
to O
a O
particular O
game O
setting O
rather O
than O
dialog O
in O
general O
, O
the O
approaches O
we O
describe O
are O
general O
in O
character O
and O
therefore O
may O
inform O
future O
work O
on O
determining O
speaker O

from O
the O

Between O

for O
each O
Mafia O

: O
1 O
to O
2 O
participants O
were O
designated O
mafia O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
were O
bystanders. O
Forty-four O
of O
these O
Mafia O

are O
included O
in O
the O
final O
analysis. O
Participants O

Waiting O

at O
$ O
5 O

. O

Upon O
recruitment O
, O
participants O
were O
shown O
a O
consent O
form O
, O
per O
IRB O
approval O
, O
followed O
by O
an O
instructional O
video O
and O
accompanying O
transcript O
describing O
how O
to O
play O
the O
text-based O
Mafia O
game O
using O
an O
interface O
we O
developed O
( O
see O
Appendix O
) O
. O
After O
they O
completed O
a O
quiz O
demonstrating O
they O
understood O
the O
information O
, O
they O
entered O
a O
waiting O
room O
until O
the O
desired O
number O
of O
participants O
was O
reached. O
Participants O
were O
then O
assigned O
a O
role O
( O
mafioso O
or O
bystander O
) O
and O
fake O
name O
, O
after O
which O
they O
began O
playing O
the O
game O
. O

The O
game O
dynamics O
were O
as O
follows. O
Each O
mafia O
member O
was O
aware O
of O
the O
roles O
of O
their O
fellow O
mafia O
members O
and O
thus O
, O
by O
process O
of O
elimination O
, O
knew O
the O
roles O
of O
the O
bystanders. O
However O
, O
the O
bystanders O
did O
not O
know O
the O
true O
role O
of O
anyone O
else O
in O
the O
game. O
The O
goal O
of O
the O
mafia O
was O
to O
eliminate O
bystanders O
until O
the O
number O
of O
mafia O
was O
greater O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
that O
of O
the O
bystanders. O
The O
goal O
of O
the O
bystanders O
was O
to O
identify O
and O
eliminate O
all O
of O
the O
mafia O
members. O
Since O
the O
incentive O
structure O
was O
set O
up O
such O
that O
bystanders O
benefited O
from O
true O
beliefs O
about O
who O
the O
mafia O
members O
were O
, O
whereas O
mafia O
members O
benefited O
from O
false O
beliefs O
, O
bystanders O
were O
thus O
motivated O
to O
be O
honest O
actors O
, O
whereas O
mafia O
members O
were O
motivated O
to O
M O
and O
B O
denote O
the O
mafioso O
and O
bystander O
classes O
, O
respectively O
, O
while O
T O
denotes O
the O
total O
number O
for O
both O
groups. O
The O
last O
row O
shows O
the O
distribution O
of O
roles O
among O
the O
players O
with O
no O
utterances O
throughout O
the O
game. O
Note O
that O
nearly O
all O
of O
the O
no-utterance O
players O
are O
bystanders O
. O

be O
deceptive O
actors O
in O
the O
Mafia O
game. O
The O
game O
proceeded O
in O
phases O
, O
alternating O
between O
nighttime O
and O
daytime O
( O
Figure O
1 O
) O
. O
During O
the O
nighttime O
, O
mafia O
members O
could O
secretly O
communicate O
to O
decide O
on O
who O
to O
eliminate O
, O
after O
which O
they O
discretely O
voted O
, O
and O
the O
person O
with O
the O
majority O
vote O
was O
eliminated O
from O
the O
game. O
If O
there O
was O
a O
tie O
, O
one O
of O
the O
people O
involved O
in O
the O
tie O
was O
randomly O
chosen O
to O
be O
eliminated. O
During O
the O
daytime O
, O
everyone O
was O
made O
aware O
of O
who O
was O
eliminated O
during O
the O
nighttime O
, O
and O
then O
all O
players O
could O
openly O
communicate O
to O
decide O
who O
to O
eliminate. O
All O
the O
players O
then O
voted O
publicly O
, O
and O
the O
person O
with O
the O
majority O
vote O
was O
eliminated O
and O
announced O
to O
be O
a O
bystander O
or O
mafioso. O
Thus O
, O
during O
the O
nighttime O
mafia O
could O
secretly O
communicate O
and O
eliminate O
anyone O
, O
whereas O
during O
the O
daytime O
mafia O
could O
participate O
in O
the O
voting O
and O
communication O
protocols O
in O
the O
same O
way O
as O
bystanders. O
The O
game O
proceeded O
until O
there O
was O
a O
winning O
faction O
according O
to O
the O
goals O
described O
above O
. O

From O
these O
experiments O
, O
we O
collected O
a O
dataset O
consisting O
of O
both O
mafia O
and O
bystander O
utterances O
over O
the O
course O
of O
each O
game O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
participants O
' O
voting O
behavior. O
Dataset O

displays O
a O

of O
the O
daytime O

from O
one O
Mafia O
game. O
As O
shown O
, O
many O

are O
either O
social O
interactions O
( O
eg. O
" O

) O
or O
discussions O
about O
what O

about O

( O

) O
. O

Upon O
further O
inspection O
of O
the O
data O
, O
we O
can O
observe O
several O
strategies O
used O
by O
mafia O
members O
to O
deceive O

Approach O
Given O
our O
mafia O
dataset O
, O
there O
are O
several O
tasks O
that O
one O
might O
address O
, O
for O
example O
, O
predicting O
participants O
' O
daytime O
voting O
behavior O
or O
generating O
mafia O
members O
' O
nighttime O
dialog. O
As O
our O
aim O
is O
to O
identify O
deceptive O
actors O
, O
however O
, O
we O
focus O
on O
predicting O
participants O
' O
roles O
, O
i.e. O
bystander O
or O
mafioso. O
Due O
to O
the O
asymmetry O
in O
the O
knowledge O
available O
to O
each O
group O
and O
the O
goals O
which O
incentivize O
bystanders O
to O
increase O
true O
belief O
and O
mafia O
members O
to O
reduce O
it O
, O
the O
bystanders O
are O
said O
to O
take O
on O
an O
honest O
role O
in O
the O
game O
, O
whereas O
the O
mafia O
members O
take O
on O
a O
deceptive O
role. O
To O
focus O
on O
the O
relationship O
between O
language O
and O
deception O
, O
we O
ignore O
voting O
behavior O
and O
consider O
just O
the O
daytime O
dialog O
in O
the O
game O
, O
as O
only O
the O
mafia O
members O
were O
able O
to O
converse O
during O
the O
nighttime. O
As O
shown O
in O
Table O
1 O
, O
since O
most O
of O
the O
players O
with O
no O
utterances O
are O
bystanders O
, O
we O
only O
consider O
players O
who O
make O
at O
least O
one O
utterance O
throughout O
the O
game O
. O

To O
investigate O
whether O
linguistic O
information O
can O
be O
used O
to O
identify O
players O
' O
roles O
, O
we O
train O
and O
evaluate O
classifiers O
that O
predict O
the O
role O
of O
a O
particular O
player. O
Since O
we O
have O
a O
small O
dataset O
, O
we O
chose O
to O
fine-tune B-MethodName
pre-trained I-MethodName
Transformer I-MethodName
models O
rather O
than O
train O
them O
from O

( O
Vaswani O

. O
To O
predict O
the O

we O
construct O

We O

it O

the O

However O

we O

that O
both O

However O
